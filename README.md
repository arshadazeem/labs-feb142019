1.	Some of the labs can be done directly through the Azure portal, but couple of labs need Visual Studio. If you do not have Visual Studio installed on your computer, please reference the VisualStudioVMCreation.doc to create a Windows VM with Visual Studio.
2.	Please reference the HandsOnLabs.pdf for instructions on the hands-on labs. This document has multiple labs, but it is self-explanatory and points to publicly available content. We are planning to do the following labs from the document today:
a.	Azure App Services – Beginner
b.	Azure Functions – Beginner & Intermediate
c.	Azure Logic Apps – Intermediate
3.	If you are planning to do AKS lab (now or later), please install kubectl on your local machine using the az aks install-cli command. If you need to install azure cli, please refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest
4.	If you want to work on API Management, please refer to https://gist.github.com/mannie/63128312256c4ddeed92c507d9709a3e
